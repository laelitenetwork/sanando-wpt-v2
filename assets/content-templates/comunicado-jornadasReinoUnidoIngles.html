			<p class="lead">Open Letter To The Venezuelan Community In The United Kingdom And Citizens Of The World</p>
			<p>
				SANANDO FOUNDATION wants to inform the general public, specially the citizens of the United Kindom, we have decided to <strong>annul</strong> the agreement signed on March 11, 2014 and discontinue our involvement with Mrs. AUSTRI VIVAS, Venezuelan citizen currently living in Brighton, London, founder of Vene Uk and Pray For Venezuela, due to several violations to our terms and conditions. This agreement granted her permission to organize and host charity events, also to contact public institutions and organizations in the pharmaceutical field in the United Kingdom, in order to obtain donations in form of medical drugs and medical supplies to help ease the health care system shortages in Venezuela, in our name.
			</p>
			<p>
				We also want to make clear that we never granted Mrs. Vivas, permission to ask for donations in form of cash. Nor, we granted her permission to organize and host events in our name in countries and regions outside of the United Kingdom.
			</p>
			<p>
				SANANDO have not yet received any drugs or medical supplies from the event hosted by Mrs. Vivas at the Saint Anne's church – 363 Kennington Lane. SE 11 5QY, Vauxhall, London, England – on March 22, 2014. She also told us, she will be hosting another charity event on April 5, 2014, however we never received any official information or notification, neither any proof this ever happened.
			</p>
			<p>
				We did not receive the list of drugs and medical supplies collected, because of that it is impossible for us to determine how many drugs and medical supplies were donated.
			</p>
			<p>
				Our Foundation received information about several charity events that may have took place on March 23, 2014 at the churches member of The Latin American Chaplaincy of London:

				On Sunday, April 6, 2014, Mrs. Vivas was notified by email that we had decided to annul our agreement. She was informed she could not act on behalf of Sanando Foundation, nor represent our organization in the United Kingdom or in any other country around the world.

			<p class="text-warning">
				Finally, we want to remind the general public that Sanando Foundation is a Nonprofit Organization, we donate drugs and medical supplies to people in need. For that reason, all drugs and medical supplies collected through charity events hosted in Venezuela or any other country around the world, <strong><u>will not be sold at any time and for any reason</u></strong>. All those drugs and medical supplies will be delivered for free everywhere in Venezuela, to all patients with prescriptions and a copy of their identity document.
			</p>
			<p class="text-warning">
				We condone the actions of certain people, which ask for donations in Venezuela and other countries around the world – sometimes in our name – , which then they sell, profiting that way from the terrible shortage of drugs and medical supplies that currently affect our country. We make a call to people around the world to recover their sense of humanity, we encourage all those who help us or want to help with our mission inside and out of Venezuela, to be responsible, transparent, diligent and to comply with our terms and conditions, in benefit of all those in need.
